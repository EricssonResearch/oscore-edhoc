                       Combining EDHOC and OSCORE
                draft-palombini-core-oscore-edhoc-latest

Abstract

   This document defines possible optimization approaches for combining
   the lightweight authenticated key exchange protocol EDHOC run over
   CoAP with the first subsequent OSCORE transaction.  This combination
   reduces the number of round trips required to set up an OSCORE
   Security Context and complete an OSCORE transaction using that
   context.

1.  Introduction

   This document presents possible optimization approaches to combine
   the lightweight authenticated key exchange protocol EDHOC
   [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc], when running over CoAP [RFC7252], with the
   first subsequent OSCORE [RFC8613] transaction.

   This allows for a minimum number of round trips necessary to setup
   the OSCORE Security Context and complete an OSCORE transaction, for
   example when an IoT device gets configured in a network for the first
   time.

   The number of protocol round trips impacts the minimum number of
   flights, which can have a substantial impact on performance with
   certain radio technologies.

   Without this optimization, it is not possible, not even in theory, to
   achieve the minimum number of flights.  This optimization makes it
   possible also in practice, since the last message of the EDHOC
   protocol can be made relatively small (see Section 1 of
   [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc]), thus allowing additional OSCORE protected
   CoAP data within target MTU sizes.

   The goal of this document is to provide details on different
   alternatives for transporting and processing the necessary data,
   gather opinions on the different approaches, and select only one of
   those.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The reader is expected to be familiar with terms and concepts defined
   in CoAP [RFC7252], CBOR [RFC8949], CBOR sequences [RFC8742], OSCORE
   [RFC8613] and EDHOC [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc].

2.  Background

   EDHOC is a 3-message key exchange protocol.  Section 7.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc] specifies how to transport EDHOC over CoAP: the
   EDHOC data (referred to as "EDHOC messages") are transported in the
   payload of CoAP requests and responses.

   This draft deals with the case of the Initiator acting as CoAP Client
   and the Responder acting as CoAP Server; instead, the case of the
   Initiator acting as CoAP Server cannot be optimized by using this
   approach.

   That is, the CoAP Client sends a POST request containing EDHOC
   message_1 to a reserved resource at the CoAP Server.  This triggers
   the EDHOC exchange on the CoAP Server, which replies with a 2.04
   (Changed) Response containing EDHOC message_2.  Finally, the CoAP
   Client sends EDHOC message_3, as a CoAP POST request to the same
   resource used for EDHOC message_1.  The Content-Format of these CoAP
   messages may be set to "application/edhoc".

   After this exchange takes place, and after successful verifications
   specified in the EDHOC protocol, the Client and Server derive the
   OSCORE Security Context, as specified in Section 7.2.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc].  Then, they are ready to use OSCORE.

   This sequential way of running EDHOC and then OSCORE is specified in
   Figure 1.  As shown in the figure, this mechanism takes 3 round trips
   to complete.

              |                                             |

                Figure 1: EDHOC and OSCORE run sequentially

   The number of roundtrips can be minimized as follows.  Already after
   receiving EDHOC message_2 and before sending EDHOC message_3, the
   CoAP Client has all the information needed to derive the OSCORE
   Security Context.

   This means that the Client can potentially send at the same time both
   EDHOC message_3 and the subsequent OSCORE Request.  On a semantic
   level, this approach practically requires to send two separate REST
   requests at the same time.

   The high level message flow of running EDHOC and OSCORE combined is
   shown in Figure 2.

   Defining the specific details of how to transport the data and of
   their processing order is the goal of this specification, as defined
   in Section 3.

3.  EDHOC in OSCORE

   The approach defined in this specification consists in sending EDHOC
   message_3 inside an OSCORE protected CoAP message.

   The resulting EDHOC + OSCORE request is in practice the OSCORE
   Request from Figure 1, sent to a protected resource and with the
   correct CoAP method and options, with the addition that it also
   transports EDHOC message_3.

   Since EDHOC message_3 may be too large to be included in a CoAP
   Option, e.g. if containing a large public key certificate chain, it
   has to be transported through the CoAP payload.

3.1.  Client Processing

   The Client prepares an EDHOC + OSCORE request as follows.

   1.  Compose EDHOC message_3 as per Section 5.4.2 of
       [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc].

       Since the Client is the EDHOC Initiator and the used Correlation
       Method is 1 (see Section 3.2.4 of [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc]), the
       EDHOC message_3 always includes the Connection Identifier C_R and
       CIPHERTEXT_3.  Note that C_R is the OSCORE Sender ID of the
       Client, encoded as a bstr_identifier (see Section 5.1 of
       [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc]).

   2.  Encrypt the original CoAP request as per Section 8.1 of
       [RFC8613], using the new OSCORE Security Context established
       after receiving EDHOC message_2.

       Note that the OSCORE ciphertext is not computed over EDHOC
       message_3, which is not protected by OSCORE.  That is, the result
       of this step is the OSCORE Request as in Figure 1.

   3.  Build a CBOR sequence [RFC8742] composed of two CBOR byte strings
       in the following order.

       *  The first CBOR byte string is the CIPHERTEXT_3 of the EDHOC
          message_3 resulting from step 3.

       *  The second CBOR byte string has as value the OSCORE ciphertext
          of the OSCORE protected CoAP request resulting from step 2.

   4.  Compose the EDHOC + OSCORE request, as the OSCORE protected CoAP
       request resulting from step 2, where the payload is replaced with
       the CBOR sequence built at step 3.

   5.  Signal the usage of this approach within the EDHOC + OSCORE
       request, by either including the new EDHOC Option (see
       Section 4.1) or by setting a particular Flag Bit of the OSCORE
       Option (see Section 4.2).

3.2.  Server Processing

   When receiving an EDHOC + OSCORE request, the Server performs the
   following steps.

   1.  Check the signalling information to identify that this is an
       EDHOC + OSCORE request (see Section 4).

   2.  Extract CIPHERTEXT_3 from the payload of the EDHOC + OSCORE
       request, as the first CBOR byte string in the CBOR sequence.

   3.  Rebuild EDHOC message_3, as a CBOR sequence composed of two CBOR
       byte strings in the following order.

       *  The first CBOR byte string has as value the 'kid' of the
          Client as indicated in the OSCORE option of the EDHOC + OSCORE
          request, encoded as a bstr_identifier (see Section 5.1 of
          [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc]).

       *  The second CBOR byte string is the CIPHERTEXT_3 retrieved at
          step 2.

   4.  Perform the EDHOC processing on the EDHOC message_3 rebuilt at
       step 3, including verifications and the OSCORE Security Context
       derivation, as per Section 5.4 and Section 7.2.1 of
       [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc], respectively.

   5.  Extract the OSCORE ciphertext from the payload of the EDHOC +
       OSCORE request, as the value of the second CBOR byte string in
       the CBOR sequence.

   6.  Rebuild the OSCORE protected CoAP request as the EDHOC + OSCORE
       request, where the payload is replaced with the OSCORE ciphertext
       resulting from step 5.

   7.  Decrypt and verify the OSCORE protected CoAP request resulting
       from step 6, as per Section 8.2 of [RFC8613], by using the new
       OSCORE Security Context established at step 4.

   8.  Process the CoAP request resulting from step 7.

   If steps 4 (EDHOC processing) and 7 (OSCORE processing) are both
   successfully completed, the Server MUST reply with an OSCORE
   protected response, in order for the Client to achieve key
   confirmation (see Section 5.4.2 of [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc]).  The usage
   of EDHOC message_4 as defined in Section 7.1 of [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc]
   is not applicable to the approach defined in this specification.

   The following sections expand on the two ways of signalling that
   EDHOC message_3 is transported in the EDHOC + OSCORE request.

4.  Signalling method

   This section defines the two possible methods that can be used to
   signal an EDHOC + OSCORE request.

4.1.  Signalling with a New EDHOC Option

   One way to signal that the Server has to extract and process EDHOC
   message_3 before processing the OSCORE protected CoAP request is to
   use a new CoAP Option, called the EDHOC Option and defined in this
   section.

   The EDHOC Option has the properties summarized in Figure 3, which
   extends Table 4 of [RFC7252].  The option is Critical, Safe-to-
   Forward, and part of the Cache-Key. The option MUST occur at most
   once and is always empty.  If any value is sent, the value is simply
   ignored.  The option is intended only for CoAP requests and is of
   Class U for OSCORE [RFC8613].

        +-----+---+---+---+---+-------+--------+--------+---------+
        | No. | C | U | N | R | Name  | Format | Length | Default |
        +-----+---+---+---+---+-------+--------+--------+---------+
        | TBD | x |   |   |   | EDHOC | Empty  |   0    | (none)  |
        +-----+---+---+---+---+-------+--------+--------+---------+
             C=Critical, U=Unsafe, N=NoCacheKey, R=Repeatable

                        Figure 3: The EDHOC Option.

   The presence of this option means that the message payload contains
   also EDHOC data, that must be extracted and processed as defined in
   Section 3.2, before the rest of the message can be processed.

   Figure 4 shows the format of a CoAP message containing both the EDHOC
   data and the OSCORE ciphertext, using the newly defined EDHOC option
   for signaling.

      Figure 4: CoAP message for EDHOC and OSCORE combined - signaled
                           with the EDHOC Option

   An example based on the OSCORE test vector from Appendix C.4 of
   [RFC8613] and the EDHOC test vector from Appendix B.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc] is given in Figure 5.  In particular, the
   example assumes that:

   *  The used OSCORE Partial IV is 0, consistently with the first
      request protected with the new OSCORE Security Context.

   *  The OSCORE Sender ID of the Client is 0x20.  This corresponds to
      the EDHOC Connection Identifier C_R, which is encoded as the
      bstr_identifier 0x08 in EDHOC message_3.

   *  The EDHOC option is registered with CoAP option number 13.

      o  OSCORE option value: 0x090020 (3 bytes)

      o  EDHOC option value: - (0 bytes)

      o  C_R: 0x20 (1 byte)

      o  CIPHERTEXT_3: 0x53c3991999a5ffb86921e99b607c067770e0 (18 bytes)

      o  EDHOC message_3: 0x08 5253c3991999a5ffb86921e99b607c067770e0
         (20 bytes)

      o  OSCORE ciphertext: 0x612f1092f1776f1c1668b3825e (13 bytes)

                           with the EDHOC Option

4.2.  Signalling with a Flag Bit in the OSCORE Option

   Another way to signal that the Server has to extract and process
   EDHOC message_3 before processing the OSCORE protected CoAP request
   is to use one of the OSCORE Flag Bits of the OSCORE Option, as
   defined below.

   Bit Position: 1

   Name: EDHOC

   Description: Set to 1 if the message payload contains also EDHOC
   data, that must be extracted and processed as defined in Section 3.2,
   before the rest of the message can be processed.

   Reference: this document

   The OSCORE Option value with the EDHOC bit set is given in Figure 6.

      Figure 7: CoAP message for EDHOC and OSCORE combined - signaled
                          within the OSCORE option

   An example based on the OSCORE test vector from Appendix C.4 of
   [RFC8613] and the EDHOC test vector from Appendix B.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc] is given in Figure 8.  The same assumptions as
   in Section 4.1 apply for this example, with respect to the OSCORE
   Partial IV and the OSCORE Sender ID of the Client.

      o  OSCORE option value without EDHOC bit set: 0x090020 (3 bytes)

      o  OSCORE option value with EDHOC bit set: 0x490020 (3 bytes)

      o  C_R: 0x20 (1 byte)

      o  CIPHERTEXT_3: 0x53c3991999a5ffb86921e99b607c067770e0 (18 bytes)

      o  EDHOC message_3: 0x08 5253c3991999a5ffb86921e99b607c067770e0
         (20 bytes)

      o  OSCORE ciphertext: 0x612f1092f1776f1c1668b3825e (13 bytes)

      From there:

      o  Protected CoAP request (OSCORE message):
         0x44025d1f 00003974
           39 6c6f63616c686f7374

5.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations from OSCORE [RFC8613] and EDHOC
   [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc] hold for this document.

   TODO (more considerations)

6.  IANA Considerations

   Depending on the chosen signaling method, this document will register
   either a new CoAP Option number to the "CoAP Option Numbers"
   registry, or a new bit to the "OSCORE Flag Bits" registry.
