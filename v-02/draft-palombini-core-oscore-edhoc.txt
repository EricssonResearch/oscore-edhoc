                       Combining EDHOC and OSCORE
                draft-palombini-core-oscore-edhoc-latest

Abstract

   This document defines possible optimization approaches for combining
   the lightweight authenticated key exchange protocol EDHOC run over
   CoAP with the first subsequent OSCORE transaction.  This combination
   reduces the number of round trips required to set up an OSCORE
   Security Context and complete an OSCORE transaction using that
   context.

1.  Introduction

   This document presents possible optimization approaches to combine
   the lightweight authenticated key exchange protocol EDHOC
   [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc], when running over CoAP [RFC7252], with the
   first subsequent OSCORE [RFC8613] transaction.

   This allows for a minimum number of round trips necessary to setup
   the OSCORE Security Context and complete an OSCORE transaction, for
   example when an IoT device gets configured in a network for the first
   time.

   The number of protocol round trips impacts the minimum number of
   flights, which can have a substantial impact on performance with
   certain radio technologies.

   Without this optimization, it is not possible, not even in theory, to
   achieve the minimum number of flights.  This optimization makes it
   possible also in practice, since the last message of the EDHOC
   protocol can be made relatively small (see Section 1 of
   [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc]), thus allowing additional OSCORE protected
   CoAP data within target MTU sizes.

   The goal of this document is to provide details on different
   alternatives for transporting and processing the necessary data,
   gather opinions on the different approaches, and select only one of
   those.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The reader is expected to be familiar with terms and concepts defined
   in CoAP [RFC7252], CBOR [I-D.ietf-cbor-7049bis], OSCORE [RFC8613] and
   EDHOC [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc].

2.  Background

   EDHOC is a 3-message key exchange protocol.  Section 7.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc] specifies how to transport EDHOC over CoAP: the
   EDHOC data (referred to as "EDHOC messages") are transported in the
   payload of CoAP requests and responses.

   This draft deals with the case of the Initiator acting as CoAP Client
   and the Responder acting as CoAP Server.  (The case of the Initiator
   acting as CoAP server cannot be optimized in this way.)  That is, the
   CoAP Client sends a POST request containing the EDHOC message 1 to a
   reserved resource at the CoAP Server.  This triggers the EDHOC
   exchange on the CoAP Server, which replies with a 2.04 (Changed)
   Response containing the EDHOC message 2.  Finally, the EDHOC message
   3 is sent by the CoAP Client in a CoAP POST request to the same
   resource used for the EDHOC message 1.  The Content-Format of these
   CoAP messages is set to "application/edhoc".

   After this exchange takes place, and after successful verifications
   specified in the EDHOC protocol, the Client and Server derive the
   OSCORE Security Context, as specified in Section 7.1.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc].  Then, they are ready to use OSCORE.

   This sequential way of running EDHOC and then OSCORE is specified in
   Figure 1.  As shown in the figure, this mechanism is executed in 3
   round trips.

                Figure 1: EDHOC and OSCORE run sequentially

   The number of roundtrips can be minimized: after receiving the EDHOC
   message 2, the CoAP Client has all the information needed to derive
   the OSCORE Security Context before sending the EDHOC message 3.

   This means that the Client can potentially send at the same time both
   the EDHOC message 3 and the subsequent OSCORE Request.  On a semantic
   level, this approach practically requires to send two separate REST
   requests at the same time.

   The high level message flow of running EDHOC and OSCORE combined is
   shown in Figure 2.

   Defining the specific details of how to transport the data and of
   their processing order is the goal of this specification.

3.  EDHOC in OSCORE

   This approach consists in sending the EDHOC message 3 inside an
   OSCORE message (i.e., an OSCORE protected CoAP message).

   The resulting OSCORE + EDHOC request is in practice the OSCORE
   Request from Figure 1, sent to a protected resource and with the
   correct CoAP method and options, with the addition that it also
   transports the EDHOC message 3.

   As the EDHOC message 3 may be too large to be included in a CoAP
   Option, e.g. if containing a large public key certificate chain, it
   would have to be transported in the CoAP payload.

   In particular, the payload of the OSCORE + EDHOC request is formatted
   as a CBOR sequence of two CBOR byte strings: the EDHOC message 3 and
   the OSCORE ciphertext of the original OSCORE Request, in this order,
   both encoded as CBOR byte strings.

   Note that the OSCORE ciphertext is not computed over the EDHOC
   message 3, which is not protected by OSCORE.  That is, the client
   first prepares the OSCORE Request as in Figure 1.  Then, it reformats
   the payload to include also the EDHOC message 3, as defined above.
   The result is the OSCORE + EDHOC request to send.

   The usage of this approach is indicated by a signalling information
   in the OSCORE + EDHOC request, which can be either a new EDHOC Option
   (see Section 3.1) or the OSCORE Option with a particular Flag Bit set
   (see Section 3.2).

   When receiving such a request, the Server needs to perform the
   following processing, in addition to the EDHOC, OSCORE and CoAP
   processing:

   1.  Check the signalling information to identify that this is an
       OSCORE + EDHOC request.

   2.  Extract the EDHOC message 3 from the payload of the OSCORE +
       EDHOC request, as the value of the first CBOR byte string in the
       CBOR sequence.

   3.  Execute the EDHOC processing on the EDHOC message 3, including
       verifications and the OSCORE Security Context derivation.

   4.  Extract the OSCORE ciphertext from the payload of the OSCORE +
       EDHOC request, as the value of the second CBOR byte string in the
       CBOR sequence.  Then, set the CoAP payload of the request to the
       extracted ciphertext.

   5.  Decrypt and verify the OSCORE protected CoAP request resulting
       from step 4, as defined by OSCORE.

   6.  Process the CoAP request resulting from step 5.

   The following sections expand on the two ways of signalling that the
   EDHOC message is transported in the OSCORE message.

3.1.  Signalling in a New EDHOC Option

   One way to signal that the Server has to extract and process the
   EDHOC message 3 before processing the OSCORE protected CoAP request
   is to use a new CoAP Option, called the EDHOC Option and defined in
   this section.

   The EDHOC Option has the properties summarized in Figure 3, which
   extends Table 4 of [RFC7252].  The option is Critical, Safe-to-
   Forward, and part of the Cache-Key. The option MUST occur at most
   once and is always empty.  If any value is sent, the value is simply
   ignored.  The option is intended only for CoAP requests and is of
   Class U for OSCORE.

        +-----+---+---+---+---+-------+--------+--------+---------+
        | No. | C | U | N | R | Name  | Format | Length | Default |
        +-----+---+---+---+---+-------+--------+--------+---------+
        | TBD | x |   |   |   | EDHOC | Empty  |   0    | (none)  |
        +-----+---+---+---+---+-------+--------+--------+---------+
             C=Critical, U=Unsafe, N=NoCacheKey, R=Repeatable

                        Figure 3: The EDHOC Option.

   The presence of this option means that the message contains EDHOC
   data in the payload, that must be extracted and processed before the
   rest of the message can be processed.

   In particular, the EDHOC message 3 has to be extracted from the CoAP
   payload, as the value of the CBOR byte string included as first
   element of a CBOR sequence.

   Figure 4 shows the format for a CoAP message containing both the
   OSCORE ciphertext and EDHOC message 3, using the newly defined EDHOC
   option for signaling.

   An example based on the OSCORE test vector from Appendix C.4 of
   [RFC8613] and the EDHOC test vector from Appendix B.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc] is given in Figure 5.  In particular, the
   example assumes that:

   *  The used Partial IV is 0, consistently with the first request
      protected with the new OSCORE Security Context.

   *  The Sender ID of the client is 0x20.  This corresponds to the
      EDHOC Connection Identifier C_R, which is encoded as the
      bstr_identifier 0x08 in EDHOC Message_3.

   *  The EDHOC option is registered with CoAP option number 13.

3.2.  Signalling in the OSCORE Option

   Another way to signal that the EDHOC message 3 is to be extracted
   from the CoAP payload as the first element of a CBOR sequence wrapped
   in a CBOR byte string, and that the processing defined in Section 3
   is to be executed, is to use one of the OSCORE Flag Bits of the
   OSCORE Option.

   Bit Position: 1

   Name: EDHOC

   Description: Set to 1 if the payload is a CBOR sequence sequence,
   including a CBOR byte string wrapping the EDHOC message 3 and a CBOR
   byte string wrapping the OSCORE ciphertext.
